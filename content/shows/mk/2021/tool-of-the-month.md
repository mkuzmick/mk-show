# TOOL OF THE MONTH CLUB

(name can be changed)

The basic gist is that each person will choose a tool and make something with it each day for a month. The thing probably needs to be an hour-thing rather than an 8-hour thing. And obviously things can aggregate into larger things. But perhaps part of the challenge is figuring out how much you can do in a day, or an hour.
