# MK SHOW YOUR WORK FOR 20210101

## FROM SLACK . . .

ok---I think I'm going to do the daily and monthly things @jk and @lf suggest, kindof interwoven.

Like, I'm going to focus on daily practices/studies/exercises/etudes in one specific tool each month (this month = GatsbyJS) . . .

. . . but since one needs to make at least placeholder content with whatever tool you're practicing, I think I'll make an X (webpage, 3D model, photo, markdown doc, Pinterest board) about a word of the day . . .

## TOOL OF THE MONTH

We know where to start, but let's also try to think a bit about what comes next, and how to harmonize with the arc of the year. 

Possibilities include:
* Resolve/Fusion and Visual Essays (February?)
* ARKit & Reality Composer or Unity (March?)
* Blender & Substance
* Logic Pro X
* Cameras
* Print/Printing
* Pens and Brushes
* Paper
* 

### JANUARY = GATSBY

Gatsby. Let's actually make a new one each day to internalize the process. And for fun, why don't we start timing this, as if training for some sort of athletic competition.

## WORD OF THE DAY

these are going to be either **Tools** or **Moves**. For today, why don't we actually make "Tool" the word of the day (and in this case, the conceptual tool of the day). 

### Tool

/tu:l/ /tul/
 ‘Any instrument of manual operation’ (Johnson); a mechanical implement for working upon something, as by cutting, striking, rubbing, or other process, in any manual art or industry; usually, one held in and operated directly by the hand (or fixed in position, as in a lathe), but also including certain simple machines, as the lathe; sometimes extended to simple instruments of other kinds

## STEPS

* `gatsby new` from dimension starter, no markdown hookup this time
* at least 5 images (large background plus one for each subpage)
* copy
	* intro
	* tools
	* media
	* next
* change footer to breadcrumbs that DO lead to markdown pages? Maybe save this for tomorrow.

* 2:30 –– starting with `gatsby new mk-gatsby-20210101 https://github.com/codebushi/gatsby-starter-dimension`
* then create [github repo](https://github.com/mkuzmick/mk-gatsby-20210101) and connect it
	```
	git remote add origin https://github.com/mkuzmick/mk-gatsby-20210101.git
	git branch -M main
	git push -u origin main
	```
* then replace the siteMetadata in `gatsby-config.js`:
	```
	siteMetadata: {
		title: `Tools, Media, and What's Next`,
		author: 'Marlon Kuzmick',
		description: `The first of 31 daily Gatsby sites I'll make this month.`,
	},
	```
* in the dimension starter, you change the icon by changing the className in the logo div you find in the `Header.js` file:
	```
	div className="logo">
		<span className="icon fa-camera-retro"></span>
	</div>
	```
* Also in the `Header.js` file change the Title and text beneath the title, along with the names for the links.
* All the text (and images) get changed over in the `Main.js` file.
* to get it up on Netlify, 

## LINKS OF THE DAY

* JK's [full CelloTap cut](https://vimeo.com/260963404)
* [Hollis link to the OED](http://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/990089379480203941/catalog)
* [this](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/07/20/how-to-integrate-netlifys-form-handling-in-a-react-app/#form-handling-with-static-site-generators) was essential reading as I worked to get Netlify forms working on a Gatsby site. Also [here](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/#html-forms) are the basic docs.
* so so tutorial, but good concept = [airtable + netlify + react stack](https://medium.com/swlh/up-and-running-with-netlify-airtable-and-react-428959473cf0)
* 




## NOTES OF THE DAY

* this list of icons at the bottom of the contact form is great--let's build one and keep it onhand:

	```
	<ul className="icons">
		<li>
			<a
			href="https://twitter.com/HuntaroSan"
			className="icon fa-twitter"
			>
			<span className="label">Twitter</span>
			</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://codebushi.com" className="icon fa-facebook">
			<span className="label">Facebook</span>
			</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://codebushi.com" className="icon fa-instagram">
			<span className="label">Instagram</span>
			</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a
			href="https://github.com/codebushi/gatsby-starter-dimension"
			className="icon fa-github"
			>
			<span className="label">GitHub</span>
			</a>
		</li>
	</ul>
	```

* ok.
