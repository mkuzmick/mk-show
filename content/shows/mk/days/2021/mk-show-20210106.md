## NOTES

now in creating gatsby let's build off of last day's if relevant. For now, we're just getting the basic md/mdx setup going.

1. `gatsby new mk-gatsby-20210106 https://github.com/mkuzmick/mk-gatsby-20210104` to clone the last minimal day
2. get it up and running
```
cd mk-gatsby-20210106
code .
gatsby develop
```
3. then create github and netlify and connect. Today we'll add the netlify cli. The first time you need this
```
npm install netlify-cli -g
netlify login
```
then all of this each time
```
```
for github, generate personal access token: 
then
```
curl -u "mkuzmick:$GITHUB_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name":"mk-gatsby-20210106","private":false}'
```

starting again, let's do this as a step by step scripted thing that can ultimately end up as a tool
```
PROJECT_NAME="mk-gatsby-20210106"
gatsby new $PROJECT_NAME https://github.com/mkuzmick/mk-gatsby-20210104
DATA_STRING="{\"name\":\"$PROJECT_NAME\",\"private\":false}"
curl -u "mkuzmick:$GITHUB_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name":"'$PROJECT_NAME'","private":false}'
cd $PROJECT_NAME


```


### CONCEPT FOR A MK GATSBY SCRIPT

```
#! /usr/bin/env zsh
PROJECT_NAME=$1
gatsby new $PROJECT_NAME $2
DATA_STRING="{\"name\":\"$PROJECT_NAME\",\"private\":false}"
curl -u "mkuzmick:$GITHUB_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name":"'$PROJECT_NAME'","private":false}'
code $PROJECT_NAME
cd $PROJECT_NAME
git remote add origin "https://github.com/mkuzmick/$PROJECT_NAME.git"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
open -a "Firefox Developer Edition" "http://localhost:8000"
open -a "Firefox Developer Edition" "http://localhost:8000/___graphql"
gatsby develop
```
