# MK SHOW YOUR WORK FOR 20210221

## start

20210221.064500

## notes

Working on [react-player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-player) today. Getting some simple YouTube background components going.

If we try to integrate some of the web stuff in person next year, mechanics like [this react youtube-sync machine](https://github.com/bramgiessen/react-youtube-sync) could be useful.

But I *actually* got there while looking for info on how perfectly you could sync playback of 2 videos on a single client for mashup and beat-matching purposes. Kindof like what's under the hood of [this YouTube DJ web app](https://youtube-dj.com/).

The basic idea of a video playing on top of itself (as fixed fluid background) seems good. Like [here](https://mk-style-lab.netlify.app/20210221) but better. Let's create a template for this to use in `.mdx` files.
