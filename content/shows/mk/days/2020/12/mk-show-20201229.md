# MK SHOW YOUR WORK FOR 20201229

## PROJECTS

Today we mainly worked on this site ([mk-show.learninglab.xyz](https://mk-show.learninglab.xyz)). Spent a *little* too much time on a detour through [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com), but everything is seeming a little bit more familiar at least.


## TOOLS

### NETLIFY

* [netlify large media overview](https://docs.netlify.com/large-media/overview/?_ga=2.135696824.865004604.1609043573-1867965387.1608479529)
* [netlify forms](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/?_ga=2.135696824.865004604.1609043573-1867965387.1608479529)
* [netlify authentication](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/oauth-provider-tokens/)

### THEME-UI

not quite sure yet whether to use [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/) for our typical Gatsby site, but we should use it on at LEAST one.

* [getting started](https://theme-ui.com/getting-started/)
* [using mdx components](https://theme-ui.com/mdx-components)
* [gatsby-starter-theme-ui](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/gatsby-starter-theme-ui)
	* I'm really wondering if this is worth the trouble right now.
* [gatsby-theme-styleguide](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-styleguide/?=theme%20ui) is elegant if we ever get theme ui working
	* written by [this guy](https://www.lekoarts.de/en)
* [another tutorial](https://egghead.io/lessons/gatsby-make-gatsby-themes-extendable-with-gatsby-theme-ui)
* [another tutorial that involves building a gatsby theme with Theme UI](https://hashinteractive.com/blog/how-to-create-your-own-gatsby-js-theme-part-two/)
* 

For now I think we'll go with styled components for a bit. When we return, we need to also understand how it relates to [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/) and [rebass](https://rebassjs.org/)


### STYLED COMPONENTS

For now I think we'll try this (for a day or so at least) before returning the Theme UI.
