key quote from [this awesome articles on CMS evolution](https://preston.so/writing/how-the-separation-of-concerns-in-content-management-systems-is-shifting/): 
>First, the channel explosion and the proliferation of new channels for content has led directly to a one-to-many relationship between CMSs and interfaces (whether we mean conversational, voice, virtual or augmented reality, or others). No longer is there a single web-based front end tightly coupled to a CMS in an inseparable monolith.
>
>Second, the same one-to-many relationship is increasingly emerging in the JavaScript world as well. While in the initial days of headless CMS architectures and decoupled Drupal we saw primarily single JavaScript front ends atop CMSs, the notion of the API as a consumable data layer for a variety of JavaScript front ends has piqued the interest of large enterprises and other organizations with many web properties.
